## Welcome to Rose's Project 3!
In this project we created a coinage code module that can calculate the total value of coin objects.


### Contents
In this project i created a p3-module.js that contained all of my javascript code. In another file called p3-server.js I created the web server for my coinage code module. I commited both of these files as git repos. In addition, I created an index.html file that contained "tests" that issued equested to the web server.
What I learned from this project was how the server and the javascript work together.
